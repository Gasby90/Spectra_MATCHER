# Spectra_MATCHER
This script allow to identify an unknown spectrum comparing it with a pure spectra library (e.g. ASCII format USGS Spectal library). When the euclidean distance calculated for each library spectrum returns a small value, then is possible that the spectrum is identified with one occurring in the library. 
Minimum euclidean distance spectrum found in the library is then displayed and comparised with the original input spectrum.
