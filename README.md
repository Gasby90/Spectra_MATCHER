# Spectra_MATCHER
This script allow to identify an unknown spectrum comparing it with a pure spectra library (e.g. ASCII USGS spectal database  when the euclidean distance calculated for each 
library spectrum returns a small value, then is possible that the spectrum is identified with the one in the library. 
Minimum euclidean distance spectrum found in the library is then displayed and comparised with the original input spectrum.
